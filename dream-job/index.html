        <h1 class="post-title">Dream job</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I believe that the concept of <em>dream job</em> is something that depends on several factors. For me, as a software engineer and not necessary in a particular order, these are most important ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organization goals</li>
<li>Competitivity</li>
<li>Work environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that I respect every point of view on this subject, my only intention here is to share my own view.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="organizationgoals">Organization goals</h3>

<p>Everyone has personal goals in their career, but I think that organization goals are just as important as ours. Both should be <strong>aligned</strong>, otherwise you won't find a suitable environment to accomplish your own goals. For instance, I once worked for a software development company that one day decided to develop a video game for iOS. At the time, I felt really excited learning new things all days: graphics engine, physics engine, sound positioning, but soon I realize that this wasn't actually my thing. I'm more interested on business applications, so I quit the job.</p>

<h3 id="competitivity">Competitivity</h3>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/hype-cycle.png" alt="hype-cycle" /></p>

<p>Remain competitive in the market is hard for a software engineer. It's not <strong>only</strong> about skills, position or salary, I think that emerging technologies, shown above on "Gartner's Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2013", somehow drives business goals and creates new challenges that software engineers must be familiar with and ready to face. For me, it's important to work in an organization that help me to remain myself competitive in all the different aspects mentioned before. The fact is, I never worked in an organization that offered me all mentioned above.</p>

<h3 id="workenvironment">Work environment</h3>

<p>Last but not least, a good work environment is really important because most of the tasks I do in my work require <strong>mental</strong> effort and creativity, like software development, design and testing. Working in an environment that has a lot of tension and conflicts is not suitable for creativity and often produces mental blocks, which means a complete incapacity of being productive at work if you happen to use your mind to work, I'm sure you're familiar with this. On my first job as a software developer I found myself on a chaotic environment and this was all produced by the lack of a software development methodology. That's where I learnt the value of it. Naturally I quit the job and I promised myself never again work for a company that doesn't back up their work with a software development methodology.</p>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>I think that probably on the next years this list would be different, but nevertheless I wanted to share this with you now because I think there are a lot of people out there trying to figure out why their employees are leaving their companies. Truth be told: every single job I left was because of these factors. I'm still looking for my <em>dream job</em>. Wish me luck.</p>
