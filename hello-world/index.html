      <p>It's been a little less than six years since my first "Hello, world". I know it's not much, but still, it feels great to start this blog in order to share my experience through this time. I really hope someone finds something useful here.</p>

<p>I'll start this by telling you a story in five small chapters:</p>

<ul>
<li>The best</li>
<li>The first</li>
<li>The naive</li>
<li>The scared</li>
<li>The dreamer</li>
</ul>

<p>I promise this won't take too long.</p>

<h3 id="thebest">The best</h3>

<p>I started my software engineering career on April 2008. I remember my first two programming courses, loved those! And I have to say, I was pretty good at them. In fact... I felt like one of the best students and it was awesome. I never was the best at anything before!</p>

<h3 id="thefirst">The first</h3>

<p>I don't remember exactly, I think it was mid 2009 when I read an article on Gizmodo about some mobile applications on a new platform making a lot of money only with one button and a thousand of fart sounds. Then I heard inside my head: "Hey! Listen! You can program that on C++, how different could it be?"</p>

<h3 id="thenaive">The naive</h3>

<p>On February 2010 I started my first job as a software developer doing Objective-C and eventually some Java programming for a <a href="http://onlinestudioproductions.com/">startup</a> at the time. It was pretty chaotic, but still felt great being paid for doing what I loved.</p>

<p>Then I published my second iOS application (I don't want to write about the first, I don't even remember that) on iTunes App Store around July 2010: <a href="http://www.appsafari.com/music/11565/iocarina/">iOcarina</a>. That went really great while it lasted, I bought my first car with that money and I have to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/cavf88">@cavf88</a> for that.</p>

<h3 id="thescared">The scared</h3>

<p>Everything until here sounds great, isn't it? Well it goes ugly from here. Nintendo wasn't happy with me using their copyrighted sounds so I had to remove my app from the store. Then, chaotic awesome went chaotic awful at work, so I quit. And it wasn't easy to quit that job, I'll tell you more about that some other time.</p>

<p>Then I felt confused, had a couple ideas for apps at my head but the App Store market wasn't the same anymore. I got a job in a couple of places but I really didn't enjoyed those. Was this really what I want for the rest of my live?</p>

<p>On May 2012 I took a Certified Scrum Master course thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/cegonya">@Cegonya</a> and I loved it! Suddenly I saw all the answers I was looking for: that was the way I wanted to work for the rest of my live, definitely.</p>

<h3 id="thedreamer">The dreamer</h3>

<p>On February 2013 I started working on a truly <a href="http://www.tallertechnologies.com/">agile organization</a>. This was awesome! Scrum, eXtreme Programming and Kanban. I worked with the best practices on software development: continuous integration, continuous delivery, unit testing and static code analysis. I also learned about the importance of open source software development and even started contributing to some small projects! And all these motivate me to start this blog.</p>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>So here I am. My name is Renzo Cris贸stomo and on this blog I'll share with you all these experiences, I hope you enjoy reading this as much I enjoy writing it.</p>
