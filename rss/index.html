But first, what's continuous delivery? which are the motivations for all this? which are the goals of this? why those tools? Wow, those are a lot of questions, so let's break the things a little in the following topics:</p>

<p>Part I:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is continuous delivery?  </li>
<li>Motivations and goals</li>
</ol>

<p>Part II:</p>

<ol>
<li>Gradle  </li>
<li>Travis  </li>
<li>TestFlight</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm dividing this in two parts because of course <em>divide and conquer</em>.</p>

<h1 id="whatiscontinuousdelivery">What is continuous delivery?</h1>

<p>Continuous delivery is a design practice used in software development to automate and improve the process of software delivery. Yes, that's <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery' >Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Probably you're familiar with this:</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/scrum-explained.png'  alt="scrum-explained" /></p>

<p>That is <a href='http://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum' >Scrum</a>, but I'm not gonna expand myself on that here, so we're just gonna focus on the two last graphics: <em>2-4 week sprint</em> and <em>protentially shipable product increment</em>. A sprint is an iteration, very similar to what we find on other agile software development methodologies and the goal of the sprint execution is a potentially shippable product increment. But, two weeks seems like a really short period of time for doing requirements, design, construction and release tasks for a set of features, so in order to get the most of it, we do <strong>automation</strong>. </p>

<h1 id="motivationsandgoals">Motivations and goals</h1>

<p>Working on mobile projects means that probably on of your main goals is <em>time to market</em>, because let's face it: mobile application development is probably one of the most competitive environments on software right now. So, in order to arrive earlier to the party, you need to decide which features will be on your first release.</p>

<p>One interesting approach to do this, and this one is actually <a href='https://developers.facebook.com/events/mobiledevcon/newyork/' #session-fb4ios">being used by Facebook</a>, is to have multiple version of the same application each one with different features. These versions are often distributed to different quality assurance teams. You think this looks complicated? Well, it's not!</p>

<p>Finally, these will be our goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build different versions of an Android application using the same code base.
<ul><li>Each version should have a determined set of features and those features should be tested individually with instrumentation framework.</li>
<li>Use different package identifiers and application icons so we can have multiple versions of the application installed and tested on the same devices.</li></ul></li>
<li>Distribute those versions individually on a continuous delivery environment.
<ul><li>Trigger distributions based on commits on a specific branch.</li>
<li>Each version should be distributed to a different set of recipients.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I guess that looks interesting, right? Keep reading the second part of this if you want to learn how to do all these.</p>]]></description><link>http://ruenzuo.github.io/continuous-delivery-on-android-with-travis/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">ae269b45-3a28-47b7-a3a0-a162c88abe9d</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renzo Crisóstomo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2013 02:55:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Three random thoughts on indie software development]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I have been thinking on three things about software development that are somehow related:</p>

<ol>
<li>What they don't tell you about Agile... or they do?  </li>
<li>You can't do everything on your own... or can you?  </li>
<li>What's the best way to do everything <em>on your own</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>How are those related? Let me explain myself.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="whattheydonttellyouaboutagile">What they don't tell you about Agile</h3>

<p>Agile is <strong>hard</strong>. Yes, we all have been lied about it. Let's analyse for instance two agile methodologies: </p>

<ul>
<li>Scrum</li>
<li>eXtreme Programming</li>
</ul>

<p>On the first, you have three main roles: scrum master, product owner and the team, let's focus on the last one. As a team member, you should be involved on several tasks performing multiple roles in diferent disciplines such as requirements, design, construction, testing, maintainance and configuration management. Specialization is not forbidden, but multi-disciplinary teams are encourage.</p>

<p>On the second, you have a set of practices and some of them are really hard to get done right, like: test driven development and coding standards are really advanced stuff for junior software developers, continuous integration and small releases are somehow difficult to accomplish depending on your IT infrastructure, collective ownership could be a nightmare done wrong. </p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/xp-practices.png'  alt="xp-practices" /></p>

<p>You get the idea.</p>

<h3 id="youcantdoeverythingonyourown">You can't do everything on your own</h3>

<p>You can't. I think some of us are getting the wrong idea about indie software development... what's indie on these days anyways? I'll explain this with two successfull independent software development <em>teams</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://tapbots.com/company/' >Tapbots</a>, creators of the amazing iOS app Tweetbot.</li>
<li><a href='http://supermeatboy.com/about/' >Team Meat</a>, creators of the video game hit Super Meat Boy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both teams are conformed by a developer and a designer, so it's clear that those aren't lone wolves and I think there's a reason about that. Most tasks on software development and design must be reviewed by different points of view, and it's so easy to miss a thing... Also, development and testing tasks should be done by someone different, otherwise is a dissaster. If you want to learn more on how this teams are organized, I recomend reading both teams blogs and watch this awesome <a href='http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/' >movie</a>.</p>

<h3 id="whatsthebestwaytodoeverythingonyourown">What's the best way to do everything <em>on your own</em></h3>

<p>Is Agile the best way? I think it is the right direction. I have been told that Apple apps teams are conformed by 3 people: a developer, a designer and a marketing analyst working with a methodology very similar to scrum. And reading both Tapbots and Team Meat blogs got me an idea on how are they organized, which is again very similar to scrum.</p>

<p>Scrum isn't recomended for teams of two people and I couldn't find information regarding an agile methodology for teams conformed by two people, so there's an interesting field of research there.</p>

<p>How are these three thoughts related?</p>

<ul>
<li>Independant software development it's <strong>hard</strong>. You have to fulfill multi-disciplinary roles and you have to be the best on each one, pretty much like doing agile, the right way.</li>
<li>You can't do everything on your own, but it seems that there is a kind of magic formula with two people teams.</li>
<li>There's an interesting field of research on this two people independent software development teams using kind of agile practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these has my attention for further research, so I'll keep you posted on this when I'll have more information.</p>]]></description><link>http://ruenzuo.github.io/three-random-thoughts-on-software-development/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">31fe8076-6792-4fc1-848f-351296ec09dc</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renzo Crisóstomo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2013 05:01:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello, world]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/hello-world.png'  alt="Hello, world" /></p>

<p>It has been a little less than six years since my first "Hello, world" program. I know it's not that much, but still feels great starting this blog to share my experience through these years. I hope someone find something usefull here.</p>

<p>I'll start this telling you a story in five small chapters:</p>

<ol>
<li>The best  </li>
<li>The first  </li>
<li>The naive  </li>
<li>The scared  </li>
<li>The dreamer</li>
</ol>

<p>I promise this won't take too long.</p>

<h3 id="thebest">The best</h3>

<p>I started my software engineering career on April 2008. I remember my first two programming courses, loved those! And I have to say, I was pretty good at them. In fact... I felt like one of the best students and it was awesome. I never was the best at anything before!</p>

<h3 id="thefirst">The first</h3>

<p>I don't remember exactly, I think it was mid 2009 when I read an article on Gizmodo about some mobile applications on a new platform making a lot of money only with one button and a thousand of fart sounds. Then I heard inside my head: "Hey! Listen! You can program that on C++, how different could it be?"</p>

<h3 id="thenaive">The naive</h3>

<p>On February 2010 I started my first job as a software developer doing Objective-C and eventually some Java programming for a <a href='http://onlinestudioproductions.com/' >startup</a> at the time. It was pretty chaotic, but still felt great being paid for doing what I loved.</p>

<p>Then I published my second iOS application (I don't want to write about the first, I don't even remember that) on iTunes App Store around July 2010: <a href='http://www.appsafari.com/music/11565/iocarina/' >iOcarina</a>. That went really great while it lasted, I bought my first car with that money and I have to thank <a href='https://twitter.com/cavf88' >@cavf88</a> for that.</p>

<h3 id="thescared">The scared</h3>

<p>Everything until here sounds great, isn't it? Well it goes ugly from here. Nintendo wasn't happy with me using their copyrighted sounds so I had to remove my app from the store. Then, chaotic awesome went chaotic awfull at work, so I quit. And it wasn't easy to quit that job, I'll tell you more about that some other time.</p>

<p>Then I felt confused, had a couple ideas for apps at my head but the App Store market wasn't the same anymore. I got a job in a couple of places but I really didn't enjoyed those. Was this really what I want for the rest of my live?</p>

<p>On May 2012 I took a Certified Scrum Master course thanks to <a href='https://twitter.com/cegonya' >@Cegonya</a> and I loved it! Suddenly I saw all the answers I was looking for: that was the way I wanted to work for the rest of my live, definitely.</p>

<h3 id="thedreamer">The dreamer</h3>

<p>On February 2013 I started working on a truly <a href='http://www.tallertechnologies.com/' >agile organization</a>. This was awesome! Scrum, eXtreme Programming and Kanban. I worked with the best practices on software development: continuous integration, continuous delivery, unit testing and static code analysis. I also learned about the importance of open source software development and even started contributing to some small projects! And all these motivate me to start this blog.</p>

<p>So here I am. My name is Renzo Crisóstomo and on this blog I'll share with you all these experiences, I hope you enjoy reading this as much I enjoy writing it.</p>]]></description><link>http://ruenzuo.github.io/hello-world/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">b2c8b04b-f895-4f7c-acfa-49c47ccfc659</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renzo Crisóstomo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2013 04:18:22 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
