There's a lot of information about iOS App Security <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/45645/ios-app-security-analysis-part-1">out there</a> and I'm pretty sure that there's at least one talk about this on each iOS development conference. But I wanted to make something different: we'll analyse a real iOS published application, not just a demo app, and we'll cover some of the most interesting topics on app security and analysis. If you want to follow up this yourself, you'll need an iOS jailbroken device and some basic knowledge about Linux Shell scripting. I'll try to keep this as simple as possible, but you'll have to figure out some things anyway.</p>

<p>We'll need some packages installed on the jailbroken device:</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenSSH</li>
<li>nano</li>
<li>Cydia Substrate </li>
<li>Cycript</li>
<li>zip</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notping">NotPing</h3>

<p>So let's get started. The iOS application we'll analyse is a game called: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notping/id852028916?mt=8">NotPing</a> by Carlos Vargas. </p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-1.png" alt="NotPing"></p>

<p>I think I mentioned Carlos before, he's a friend of mine studying computer science and working as a Generalist Programmer at Ubisoft Montreal. He gladly agreed to take part on this:</p>

<p>I highly recommend you to follow him on <a href="https://twitter.com/cavf88">Twitter</a>, he's always sharing cool stuff about game programming.</p>

<p>Well, I don't want to spoil the fun of NotPing, so I won't explain the game mechanics. If you want to find more about the game, download it. The game has Game Center integration, that's pretty cool, and the high scores on the leaderboard are really impressive:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-11.png" alt="NotPing-game"></p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-2.PNG" alt="high-scores-1"></p>

<p>And mine is not. I would like to see my name there, let's do that.</p>

<h3 id="viewhierarchyinspection">View hierarchy inspection</h3>

<p>The very first thing I like to do is inspect the view hierarchy of the app. You can learn so much while doing this, just by checking the view classes for instance you could find which frameworks have been used to make the app: if it's using UIKit or something similar or if everything is OpenGL, among other things.</p>

<p>Peter Steinberger has an amazing <a href="http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2013/how-to-inspect-the-view-hierarchy-of-3rd-party-apps/">blog post</a> about this. The first thing we'll need is <a href="http://revealapp.com/">Reveal</a>, which is an amazing view hierarchy inspector and if you don't have it yet, you should but it now. You can evaluate Reveal for free . Then we'll need the NotPing's App ID, so how we get that? There are a lot of ways to do this, but a pretty simple one is just unzip the IPA file. You can find the IPA file on the following path:</p>

<p><code>~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications</code></p>

<p>Inside the directory, you'll find something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-3.png" alt="ipa"></p>

<p>Just open the file with Archive Utility and you'll find something like this inside:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-4.png" alt="ipa-inside"></p>

<p>We're interested on the property file there. Open it and look for <code>softwareVersionBundleId</code>, that's what we're looking for: </p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-5.png" alt="plist"></p>

<p>The next thing we need to do is to find both the iOS device and your machine IP addresses. For that you can go to Settings on iOS and System Preferences on OS X:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-7.png" alt="Settings"></p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-6.png" alt="System-Preferences"></p>

<p>OK cool, now we can SSH into the jailbroken device. We'll use <code>scp</code> to transfer the Reveal framework from our PC to the device:</p>

<p><code>scp -r /Applications/Reveal.app/Contents/SharedSupport/iOS-Libraries/Reveal.framework root@192.168.0.20:/System/Library/Frameworks</code></p>

<p>Then, we'll SSH into the device and use <code>nano</code> to create a property list for Reveal:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-8.png" alt="nano-1"></p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-9.png" alt="nano-2"></p>

<p>Great! We're almost done. Now just respring with <code>killall SpringBoard</code> and launch Reveal:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-10.png" alt="Reveal"></p>

<p>Isn't that awesome? Looks like NotPing is using a SKView as a root view, this means it has been built using SceneKit.</p>

<h3 id="classdump">Class dump</h3>

<p>The next thing we'll do is retrieve all the application headers so we get an idea of how the app is architected. We'll use Cycript for this, a tool to explore and modify running applications created by Jay Freeman A.K.A. <a href="https://twitter.com/saurik">saurik</a>, if you don't know who he is I think you should take a break now and google him up. We'll load <a href="https://github.com/limneos/weak_classdump">this</a> script created by Elias Limneos, a well known hacker on the jailbreak community into the app. Transfer the script into the device's home directory and execute the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-12.png" alt="weak_classdump"></p>

<p>Once you hear the lock sound, zip the generated headers and transfer those back to your computer using <code>scp</code> again:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-13.png" alt="zip-1"></p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-14.png" alt="zip-2"></p>

<p>Let's look into this, a good start point are class singletons, like the AppDelegate:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-15.png" alt="AppDelegate"></p>

<p>OK, sadly this time that was not very useful. But let's keep looking for other singletons, there's a class that sure looks interesting:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-16.png" alt="GameManager"></p>

<p><code>GameManager</code> has a particularly interesting method called <code>- (void)setHighScore:(int)arg1</code>. I think we found our method, but we need to be sure that this method will send the highscore to Game Center. But how we do that? I guess it's time for some assembly inspection.</p>

<h3 id="iosbinariesdecryption">iOS binaries decryption</h3>

<p>iOS binaries are encrypted using Apple's FairPlay encryption. So, in order to decrypt those binaries we'll use Stefan Esser's <a href="https://github.com/stefanesser/dumpdecrypted">dumpdecrypted</a>. Stefan Esser A.K.A <a href="https://twitter.com/i0n1c">i0n1c</a> is a security researcher and also my personal hero. Clone the repository and run <code>make</code> at the root, then <code>scp</code> the generated dynamic library into the device and run the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-17.png" alt="dumpdecrypted-1"></p>

<p>Transfer back the decrypted binary using <code>scp</code> again:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-18.png" alt="dumpdecrypted-2"></p>

<h3 id="iosbinariesanalysis">iOS binaries analysis</h3>

<p>Now we'll need a disassembler. I particularly like <a href="http://www.hopperapp.com/">Hopper</a>, it's pretty cheap compared to others, it has great features and it's constantly updated. You can also evaluate Hopper for free. Open the decrypted binary with Hopper:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-19.png" alt="Hopper-1"></p>

<p>And now you'll see a lot of assembly code:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-20.png" alt="Hopper-2"></p>

<p>But don't panic just yet! I said Hopper had great features, so let's use them. Select from the tag scope the <code>GameManager</code> class and then select the <code>[GameManager setHighScore:]</code> method:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-21.png" alt="Hopper-3"></p>

<p>Now that look's better, but not quite what we're looking for. There's an option on the top right corner to show the Pseudo Code:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-22.png" alt="Hopper-4"></p>

<p>Now that's it! Everything it's pretty clear now: </p>

<ul>
<li>It takes a <code>long</code> number parameter.</li>
<li>Instantiates an <code>NSNumber</code> with it.</li>
<li>It does some if statement to select the correct board identifier.</li>
<li>And finally it uses a helper class to send the score to  Game Center. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="modifyarunningiosapplication">Modify a running iOS application</h3>

<p>Now we'll use Cycript again to execute that method with our high score. We'll call the <code>choose</code> function which returns an array of all the objects that match the Objective-C class argument:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-23.png" alt="Hopper-4"></p>

<p>And there we have it:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/ios-security-24.png" alt="high-scores-2"></p>

This pattern has prove useful to me while developing <em>engaging</em> user experiences on mobile applications, why? Because mobile applications users expect apps to perform far better than web counterparts, and we can provide that experience by using system resources like disk (databases) and memory (caches) storages. </p>

<p>But if we don't structure all these system resources access methods in a comprehensive way we could risk ending up with a software design mess. Here's where the façade software design pattern comes into play, providing a single interface to solve a problem with different implementations.</p>

<p>To provide implementation examples, I'll be referencing these <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-facade-example">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-facade-example">Android</a> repositories. I'm not going to cover implementation details. I'll mostly cover the open source libraries I'm using and how I'm using them together, but if you're interested in implementation details feel free to leave me a message or send me an email to <a href="mailto:renzo.crisostomo@me.com">renzo.crisostomo@me.com</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="faadesoftwaredesignpatternexplained">Façade software design pattern explained</h3>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, that doesn't says much. So let's analyze a typical use case first.</p>

<p>Let's say we want to build an app that uses a REST API. We'll need to do network HTTP requests in order to retrieve data form that API, but we can't do this all the time because network requests are <strong>expensive</strong>, they consume battery and they take a lot of time depending on network conditions, so it make sense to cache the network request responses using all the provided mechanisms of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html">HTTP protocol</a>. But what happens when the user doesn't have internet access? We could use databases and that would be fine, but disk I/O can be also expensive, depending of the database optimization that you could use, and if those requests will be done in a regular basis, it make sense to cache those too, we can use memory storage for that. </p>

<p>I guess that looks complex, we'll the truth is that not all the applications need to do all this, but if you're willing to use all the methods mentioned above in your application, you need to structure your classes in a comprehensive way. Take a look at this class diagram:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/GitHub/android-facade-screenshot-5.png" alt="class-diagram"></p>

<p>Here we have four classes, a manager and 3 helpers, implementing the same interface. Helpers are implementing the methods described above and the manager decides, depending several factors, which helper should be used to retrieve the requested data. Next, I'll talk a little about the libraries and techniques I've used to implement each helper both on iOS and Android.</p>

<h3 id="objectserialization">Object serialization</h3>

<p>Not pictured on the class diagram above for the sake of simplicity, but I'm using another helper: a translator helper. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, in the context of data storage, serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link) and reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Object serialization has prove useful to me because it allows to manage any kind of data as objects. This objects are used as the input/output of the façade interfaces methods. Two powerful object serialization libraries I use are <a href="https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle">Mantle</a> on iOS and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/">Gson</a> on Android. Both are able to translate JSON into model objects. You can find my translator helper implementation both on <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/Helpers/TranslatorHelper.m">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/src/main/java/com/ruenzuo/weatherapp/helpers/TranslatorHelper.java">Android</a> on the repositories mentioned earlier. These objects can implement other persistence strategies, like ActiveRecord, which I'll describe next.</p>

<h3 id="activerecord">Active record</h3>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Active record is an approach to accessing data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped into a class. Thus, an object instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object, a new row is added to the table upon save. Any object loaded gets its information from the database. When an object is updated the corresponding row in the table is also updated. The wrapper class implements accessor methods or properties for each column in the table or view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to object serialization, now we have the data as objects, which can implement this pattern. Two powerful active record libraries I use are <a href="https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord">MagicalRecord</a> on iOS and <a href="https://github.com/pardom/ActiveAndroid">ActiveAndroid</a> on Android. Implementing this pattern with both libraries is as easy as declare an inheritance or import a category, but I like to wrap the method calls on database helper. You can find my database helper implementation both on <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/Helpers/DatabaseHelper.m">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/src/main/java/com/ruenzuo/weatherapp/helpers/DatabaseHelper.java">Android</a> on the repositories mentioned earlier. Next, I'll cover network and memory caches.</p>

<h3 id="networkandmemorycaches">Network and Memory caches</h3>

<p>Enabling network cache is often as simple as declaring the size of it (really, see <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/Application/AppDelegate.m#L29-L32">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/src/main/java/com/ruenzuo/weatherapp/helpers/NetworkingHelper.java#L35-L37">Android</a>). Two powerful networking libraries that I use are <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking">AFNetworking</a> on iOS and <a href="https://github.com/square/okhttp">OkHttp</a> on Android. Keep in mind that this will only work if the API that you're using is following the HTTP protocol cache methods. Memory cache on the other hard could be a little more tricky: you need to set up a key-value storage and specify a cache invalidation method. Two powerful memory cache libraries that I use are <a href="https://github.com/tumblr/TMCache">TMCache</a> on iOS and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/">Guava</a> on Android. You can find my memory cache helper implementation both on <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/Helpers/CacheHelper.m">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/src/main/java/com/ruenzuo/weatherapp/helpers/MemoryCacheHelper.java">Android</a> on the repositories mentioned earlier.</p>

<h3 id="synchronizinglargedatasets">Synchronizing large datasets</h3>

<p>Techniques mentioned above, including the façade pattern haven't proved useful to me while synchronizing large datasets. I still haven't find any satisfying method to do this. I've seen some people downloading a pre-made database, but this can be tricky if your data varies a lot between users. What I'm doing now is running long background tasks and saving data on the database as often as I can, so the façade methods avoid network requests as much as possible. On iOS I'm using <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/Operations/CitiesOperation.m">operations</a> and on Android I'm using <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-facade-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/src/main/java/com/ruenzuo/weatherapp/services/SyncService.java">services</a>. Be warned, code is really messy there, I'm not using any design pattern.</p>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>Things to keep in consideration while implementing something similar to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>250 countries <a href="http://api.geonames.org/countryInfoJSON?username=WeatherApp">data set</a> took ~4 seconds to retrieve (serialized) from network, ~0.8 seconds from database and ~0.2 from memory (on an iPhone 4s and a Nexus 5), according to my own benchmarks which you can try yourself, among other things, on the repositories mentioned above.</li>
<li>Avoid network request as much as possible. Test your network cache methods.</li>
<li>Avoid cache a large amount of objects in memory and test your cache invalidation methods.</li>
<li>ActiveRecord and object serialization are two things difficult to get together on the same model. In my experience, using <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-facade-example/tree/master/WeatherApp/Models">two different models</a> on iOS is not such a bad idea, but probably there are better ways to do that.</li>
<li>All these is often over complex for most applications, it's up to you to decide when to use each of these strategies, or to use them all.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll hope this was helpful to you and please contact me if you have any inquiry about it.</p>]]></description><link>http://ruenzuo.github.io/facade-software-design-pattern-on-ios-and-android/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">895b729d-f4c6-4bfa-b35d-40b186c8f519</guid><category><![CDATA[Android]]></category><category><![CDATA[iOS]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renzo Crisóstomo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2014 15:18:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2014]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It's been 3 months since my last blog post, but this doesn't mean that I have given up with this!

If you're interested in what are those metrics or what are the motivations behind this, be sure to check the <a href="http://ruenzuo.github.io/static-analysis-on-ios-part-i/index.html">first part</a> of this post.</p>

<p>The following assumes that you have basic knowledge about <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins CI</a> and Linux <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">Shell</a> scripting.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="buildsystem">Build system</h3>

<p>We'll be using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/xctool">xctool</a> as our build system for this. Advantages of this over the regular <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcodebuild.1.html">xcodebuild</a> are well described by Mattt Thompson on <a href="http://nshipster.com/xctool/">NSHipster</a>. Basically, we're gonna need compilation output in reports (namely junit and json-compilation-database formats) and xctool already includes these reporters.</p>

<p>So, to setup xctool with your project, you will need to install the script on your computer and add a <code>.xctool-args</code> file on your repository. Refer xctool documentation for information about this, but you'll need something like <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-ci-jenkins-example/blob/master/.xctool-args">this</a>.</p>

<h3 id="testresultsandcodecoverage">Test results and Code coverage</h3>

<p>You will need something like this on your CI server job in order to get test results:</p>

<p><code>xctool -reporter junit:Build/junit.xml clean test</code></p>

<p>This will run your test target and store the results on <code>Build/junit.xml</code> in the classic junit format. Most Jenkins CI installations already come with <strong>post-build actions</strong> for  JUnit test result publishing, just setup one of those and you'll get something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/GitHub/test_results.png" alt="test_results"></p>

<p>If you happen to run with this error on your CI server:</p>

<p><code>ERROR: Cannot find schemes. Please consider creating shared schemes in Xcode.</code></p>

<p>It means that you'll need to set your scheme to shared on Xcode. You can do this on Product > Schemes > Manage schemes.</p>

<p>Getting the code coverage is a little harder. First, you'll need to turn on two flags on your project <strong>debug main target</strong>: <code>Generate Test Coverage Files</code> and <code>Instrument Program Flow</code>. Then, you'll need to run something like this:</p>

<p><code>xctool clean test OBJROOT=./Build</code></p>

<p>This will store the test coverage files on a path I will describe on the next script, but first you need to install <a href="http://gcovr.com/">GCOVR</a> (I always install those scripts on <code>/opt/scripts/</code>), a tool that will translate these results into Cobertura XML format. Then, you can get the cobertura results with this:</p>

<p><code>/opt/scripts/gcovr -r . --object-directory Build/TestingApp.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/WeatherApp.build/Objects-normal/i386 --exclude '.*Tests.*' --exclude '.*main.*' --xml &gt; Build/coverage.xml</code></p>

<p>See that we're looking inside <code>Debug-iphonesimulator</code>, the target where we enable the two flags. On Jenkins CI, you will need to install <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin">Cobertura plugin</a>, setup a post-build action and publish those results. You'll get something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/GitHub/code_coverage.png" alt="code_coverage"></p>

<p>If you're getting blank results, at the time of this writing, there's a bug with Xcode 5. In order to get pass through this, you will need to call <code>__gcov_flush()</code> from your application using a <strong>test hook</strong>, details on how to do this are shared on this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19136767/generate-gcda-files-with-xcode5-ios7-simulator-and-xctest">StackOverflow</a> question.</p>

<h3 id="pmdanalysisresults">PMD analysis results</h3>

<p>First, install <a href="http://oclint.org/">OCLint</a>. This tool will need a <code>json-compilation-database</code> which is just the list of commands that xcodebuild runs. You can get those with xctool using the following:</p>

<p><code>xctool -reporter json-compilation-database:compile_commands.json clean build</code></p>

<p>Then, run OCLint:</p>

<p><code>oclint-json-compilation-database -e Pods/** -- -max-priority-1 20 -max-priority-2 50 -max-priority-3 100 -report-type pmd -o Build/oclint.xml</code></p>

<p>There we're excluding Pods directory, because we're not interested on those sources. <strong>Max priority</strong> values are set in order to make the build fail if those are exceeded.</p>

<p>In order to publish those results on your Jenkins CI, you'll need to install <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PMD+Plugin">PMD plugin</a>, setup a post-build action and publish those results. Then you'll get something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/GitHub/static_analysis.png" alt="static_analysis"></p>

<h3 id="duplicatecodetrends">Duplicate code trends</h3>

<p>This one is fairly straightforward. You'll need to download <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/">PMD</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jkennedy1980/Objective-C-CPD-Language">Objective-C-CPD-Language</a> (PMD version 4.2.5 and Objective-C-CPD-Language version 0.0.7 worked for me). Then run something like this:</p>

<p><code>java -Xmx512m -classpath /Applications/pmd/lib/pmd-4.2.5.jar:/Applications/pmd/lang/ObjCLanguage-0.0.7-SNAPSHOT.jar net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.CPD --minimum-tokens 10 --language ObjectiveC --encoding UTF-8 --format net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.XMLRenderer --files WeatherApp --files WeatherAppTests &gt; Build/cpd-output.xml</code></p>

<p>In order to publish those results on your Jenkins CI, you'll need to install <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/DRY+Plugin">DRY plugin</a>, setup a post-build action and publish those results. Then you'll get something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/GitHub/duplicate_code.png" alt="duplicate_code"></p>

<h3 id="sourcelinesofcodecount">Source lines of code count</h3>

<p>First, install <a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/">CLOC</a>. Then run something like this:</p>

<p><code>cloc --by-file --xml -out=Build/cloc.xml WeatherApp</code></p>

<p>This will store the source lines of code count on a xml file but in order to get those published by Jenkins CI, we'll need to translate that xml to <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/">SLOCCount</a> format with this:</p>

<p><code>xsltproc Utils/Sloccount-format.xls Build/cloc.xml &gt; Build/cloccount.sc</code></p>

<p><code>xsltproc</code> already comes preinstalled on OSX and you can grab an example of <code>Sloccount-format.xls</code> <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-ci-jenkins-example/blob/master/Utils/Sloccount-format.xls">here</a>. The reason why I'm doing this is because I couldn't get <code>SLOCCount</code> work on OSX Mavericks for some reason, so if you can solve this, please let me know.</p>

<p>In order to publish those results on your Jenkins CI, you'll need to install <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SLOCCount+Plugin">SLOCCount plugin</a>, setup a post-build action and publish those results. Then you'll get something like this:</p>

<p>I like to have my scripts inside a <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-ci-jenkins-example/tree/master/Scripts">directory</a> on the project repository, but that's up to you. We surely can do some optimizations here, like for example run <code>xctool test</code> only once and attach all the needed <code>-reporter</code> parameters. I let you experiment with that. </p>

Probably you're already familiar with this concept, if not, this is an analysis performed on the source code in order to get its quality metrics. Remember: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming">"You can't improve what you don't measure"</a>.</p>

<p>I'll be diving this in two parts. On the first I'll cover the metrics I use, briefly describing each one of them. On the second part I'll show you how to configure these quality metrics on a dashboard using Jenkins continuous integration server. For this last part, I'll be referencing <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ios-ci-jenkins-example">this</a> repository a lot.</p>

<p>The quality metrics described below are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test results and Code coverage</li>
<li>PMD analysis results</li>
<li>Duplicate code trends</li>
<li>Source lines of code count</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="testresultsandcodecoverage">Test results and Code coverage</h3>

<p>Unit testing is a <strong>fundamental</strong> part of the software development process. As described on Mike Cohn's book "Succeeding with Agile", testing automation efforts on software development should be distributed as shown below:</p>

<p><center> <br>
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/test-pyramid.png" alt="test-pyramid">
</center></p>

<p>This means that <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-forgotten-layer-of-the-test-automation-pyramid">"unit testing should be the foundation of a solid test automation strategy and as such represents the largest part of the pyramid"</a>.</p>

<p>This is why this two metrics are are important to me, test results helps you to identify which builds have been broken and coverage gives you interesting information about how much of your code is being covered by your unit tests.</p>

<h3 id="pmdanalysisresults">PMD analysis results</h3>

<p><a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/">PMD</a> is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth. Currently, PMD doesn't have official support for ObjC, but on the second part of this post I'll cover how to get through this.</p>

<p>I found this metrics interesting because it helps me to write <strong>clean code</strong> avoiding common errors like long non-commenting source statements, long lines, switch statements without default, unnecessary else statements, unused method parameters and so on.</p>

<h3 id="duplicatecodetrends">Duplicate code trends</h3>

<p>This metric shows you code duplication tagging two sections of the source file. It compares them with a set of parameters you specify to give you the results. This helps you with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> software development principle.</p>

<p>There's nothing more to say about this metric besides that is possible the <strong>hardest to configure</strong> of all, mostly because the parameters you specify to the program depends on the coding style of the frameworks you use and your team, which may not be the same at all.</p>

<h3 id="sourcelinesofcodecount">Source lines of code count</h3>

<p>I believe that source lines of code count by itself doesn't really mean <em>anything</em>. You can't measure the size or complexity of a software program only by lines of code count, but this metric is really helpful if it's used with the other described above, specially with duplicate code trends. This is possibly the <strong>hardest to analyze</strong> of all, because it depends mostly on the complexity of the project and the team.</p>

<p>If you found this interesting, keep reading the <a href="http://ruenzuo.github.io/static-analysis-on-ios-part-ii/index.html">second part</a> of this to learn how to configure these quality metrics.</p>]]></description><link>http://ruenzuo.github.io/static-analysis-on-ios-part-i/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56cdceff-0956-4370-a411-2d52279967e1</guid><category><![CDATA[iOS]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renzo Crisóstomo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 17:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dream job]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I believe that the concept of <em>dream job</em> is something that depends on several factors. For me, as a software engineer, these are the most important ones, not necessarily in a particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organization goals</li>
<li>Competitivity</li>
<li>Work environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that I respect every point of view on this subject, my only intention here is to share my own view.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="organizationgoals">Organization goals</h3>

<p>Everyone has personal goals in their career, but I think that organization goals are just as important as ours. Both should be <strong>aligned</strong>, otherwise you won't find a suitable environment to accomplish your own goals. For instance, I once worked for a software development company that one day decided to develop a video game for iOS. At the time, I felt really excited learning new things all days: graphics engine, physics engine, sound positioning, but soon I realize that this wasn't actually my thing. I'm more interested on business applications, so I quit the job.</p>

<h3 id="competitivity">Competitivity</h3>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/hype-cycle.png" alt="hype-cycle"></p>

<p>Remain competitive in the market is hard for a software engineer. It's not <strong>only</strong> about skills, position or salary, I think that emerging technologies, shown above on "Gartner's Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2013", somehow drives business goals and creates new challenges that software engineers must be familiar with and ready to face. For me, it's important to work in an organization that help me to remain myself competitive in all the different aspects mentioned before. The fact is, I never worked in an organization that offered me all mentioned above.</p>

<h3 id="workenvironment">Work environment</h3>

<p>Last but not least, a good work environment is really important because most of the tasks I do in my work require <strong>mental</strong> effort and creativity, like software development, design and testing. Working in an environment that has a lot of tension and conflicts is not suitable for creativity and often produces mental blocks, which means a complete incapacity of being productive at work if you happen to use your mind to work, I'm sure you're familiar with this. On my first job as a software developer I found myself on a chaotic environment and this was all produced by the lack of a software development methodology. That's where I learnt the value of it. Naturally I quit the job and I promised myself never again work for a company that doesn't back up their work with a software development methodology.</p>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>I think that probably on the next years this list would be different, but nevertheless I wanted to share this with you now because I think there are a lot of people out there trying to figure out why their employees are leaving their companies. Truth be told: every single job I left was because of these factors. I'm still looking for my <em>dream job</em>. Wish me luck.</p>]]></description><link>http://ruenzuo.github.io/dream-job/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">b780ef1f-f781-4045-b6a0-436af7fe2265</guid><category><![CDATA[Personal]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renzo Crisóstomo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2013 15:25:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Continuous Delivery on Android - Part II]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is the second part of my post about continuous delivery setup on Android using <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> and <a href="https://www.testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a>.

<hr>

<h3 id="gradle">Gradle</h3>

<p>Gradle has been chosen by Google's ADT team to be Android's <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide">next build system</a> so Ant support will be dropped sometime in the future. The following assumes that you have basic knowledge about Android's gradle plugin and Groovy domain-specific language.</p>

<p>I'll make a brief explanation of my <code>build.gradle</code> file shown below in 3 sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build configurations</li>
<li>Product flavors</li>
<li>Dependencies</li>
</ul>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Ruenzuo/7668340.js"></script>

<h4 id="buildconfigurations">Build Configurations</h4>

<p>For this example, I'm using <code>targetSdkVersion 18</code> and <code>buildToolsVersion "18.0.1"</code>.</p>

<p>I'm setting <code>debuggable true</code> and <code>zipAlign true</code> on the default debug build type because this will be the APK I'll be delivering with TestFlight.</p>

<h4 id="productflavors">Product flavors</h4>

<p>I'm adding two product flavors <code>free</code> and <code>paid</code>. You need to configure your project <code>src</code> directory to something <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-cd-travis-example/tree/master/WeatherApp/src">like</a> this so gradle can grab the correct files for compiling each version. You're free to add different resources for each version, for instance, you can add <strong>different application icons</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-cd-travis-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/src/free/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_launcher.png">free</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-cd-travis-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/src/paid/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_launcher.png">paid</a> icons) on each <code>res</code> directory.</p>

<p>For each product flavor, I'm configuring a different <code>packageName</code>, in order to be able to <strong>install both versions on the same device</strong>, and adding a <code>buildConfig</code> variable which can be used from anywhere on the project, for example: to <strong>enable or disable features</strong> on the <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-cd-travis-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/src/main/java/com/ruenzuo/weatherapp/base/CitiesBaseActivity.java#L49">base code</a> or <strong>to test specific features for each build</strong> on your <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-cd-travis-example/blob/master/WeatherApp/src/instrumentTest/java/com.ruenzuo.weatherapp.test/CitiesActivityFunctionalTests.java#L28">tests</a>.</p>

<h4 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h4>

<p>With gradle, you can also specify specific product flavor dependencies, to make APK lighter, and exclude transitive dependencies, so compiler doesn't complain about duplicated files on compilation. In this example, we don't need to compile <code>libs/GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.4.1.jar</code> on paid version because its not referenced.</p>

<h3 id="travis">Travis</h3>

<p>Travis is a is a hosted continuous integration service for the open source community. It's fully integrated with GitHub. The following assumes that you have basic knowledge about Travis, unix shell and Android command line tools.</p>

<p>I'll explain the most important parts of my <code>.travis.yml</code> file shown below in 5 sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Branches</li>
<li>Before install</li>
<li>Install</li>
<li>Before script</li>
<li>Script</li>
</ul>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Ruenzuo/7668407.js"></script>

<h4 id="branches">Branches</h4>

<p>In this part, I'm telling Travis to <strong>build only master branch</strong>. Any commit on the master branch will trigger a build, but this can be avoided by adding <code>[ci skip]</code> to the <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-cd-travis-example/commit/5a5f37b18bd822075f33d00087ceb217cf0e0798">commit message</a>.</p>

<h4 id="beforeinstall">Before install</h4>

<p>Sadly, Travis doesn't offer an Android development environment so we need to install everything by our own. This is done on <code>before_install</code> part of the script.</p>

<h4 id="install">Install</h4>

<p>I'm skipping the default <code>install</code> behaivour of Travis described <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java/#Projects-Using-Gradle">here</a>, because I really don't need it, I'm using gradle wrapper which I think it's the best.</p>

<h4 id="beforescript">Before script</h4>

<p>On <code>before_script</code> I'm using <a href="https://github.com/Ruenzuo/android-cd-travis-example/blob/master/Scripts/wait_for_emulator.sh">this</a> script to launch the simulator and wait until it's ready, then I'm using <code>adb shell input keyevent 82 &amp;</code> which gives the virtual device an unlock message.</p>

<h4 id="script">Script</h4>

<p>Finally, on <code>script</code> I'm using the gradle wrappler to run instrument tests, this task will also generate debug APK both for free and paid flavors on the following path <code>$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/WeatherApp/build/apk/</code>. The rest of the script will be described on the next topic.</p>

<h3 id="testflight">TestFlight</h3>

<p>TestFlight is a free platform used to distribute beta and internal iOS/Android applications to team members over-the-air. The following assumes that you have basic knowledge about the service.</p>

<p>As we seen on the last section <code>script</code> of the <code>.travis.yml</code> file, I'm using <code>curl</code> to upload both APKs to TestFlight API adding <code>distribution_lists</code> parameter so <strong>each version is distributed to a different set of recipients</strong>.</p>

<p>For this, you need to create and configure two applications on TestFlight:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/testflight.png" alt="testflight"></p>

<p>Get the <code>api_token</code> and <code>team_token</code> from TestFlight and create the desired number of <code>distribution_lists</code>. You can find this option on the bottom of the People section of the webpage:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/distribution-lists.png" alt="distribution-lists"></p>

<p>Remember that you can specify if you want to <code>notify</code> those users about a new build. Another cool thing you can do is to add <code>notes</code> for the build information, here you can use Travis <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Environment-variables">environment variables</a> to add interesting information to those notes.</p>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>Hopefully you get everything right. But if not, just send me an an email to <a href="mailto:renzo.crisostomo@me.com">renzo.crisostomo@me.com</a>. Good luck and thanks for reading.</p>]]></description><link>http://ruenzuo.github.io/continuous-delivery-on-android-part-ii/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">25e06908-3cfd-4a1c-8ab3-2ddbdb683003</guid><category><![CDATA[Android]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renzo Crisóstomo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2013 22:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Continuous Delivery on Android - Part I]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Today I'll share a continuous delivery setup on Android using <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> and <a href="https://www.testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a>. I'm assuming that you are familiar with those tools, so I'll be covering all these in the following topics:</p>

<p>Part I:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is continuous delivery?</li>
<li>Motivations and goals</li>
</ul>

<p>Part II:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gradle</li>
<li>Travis</li>
<li>TestFlight</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm dividing this in two parts because of course divide and conquer.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="whatiscontinuousdelivery">What is continuous delivery?</h3>

<p>Continuous delivery is a design practice used in software development to automate and improve the process of software delivery. Yes, that's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Probably you're familiar with this:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/scrum-explained.png" alt="scrum-explained"></p>

<p>That is <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum">Scrum</a>, but I will not explain this here, we will only focus on the last two graphs: 2-4 week sprint and potentially shippable product increment. A sprint is an iteration, very similar to what we find on other agile software development methodologies and the goal of the sprint execution is a potentially shippable product increment. But, two weeks seems like a really short period of time for doing requirements, design, construction and release tasks for a set of features, so in order to get the most of it, we do <strong>automation</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="motivationsandgoals">Motivations and goals</h3>

<p>Working on mobile projects means that probably on of your main goals is time to market, because let's face it: mobile application development is probably one of the most competitive environments on software right now. So, in order to arrive earlier to the party, you need to decide which features will be on your first release.</p>

<p>One interesting approach to do this, and this one is actually <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/03/12/facebook-mobile-developer-conference-2013/">being used by Facebook</a>, is to have multiple version of the same application each one with different features. These versions are often distributed to different quality assurance teams. You think this looks complicated? Well, it's not!</p>

<p>Finally, these will be our goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build different versions of an Android application using the same code base.</li>
<li>Each version should have a determined set of features and those features should be tested individually with instrumentation framework.</li>
<li>Use different package identifiers and application icons so we can have multiple versions of the application installed and tested on the same devices.</li>
<li>Distribute those versions individually on a continuous delivery environment.</li>
<li>Trigger distributions based on commits on a specific branch.</li>
<li>Each version should be distributed to a different set of recipients.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess that looks interesting, right? Keep reading the <a href="http://ruenzuo.github.io/continuous-delivery-on-android-part-ii/">second part</a> of this if you want to learn how to do all these.</p>]]></description><link>http://ruenzuo.github.io/continuous-delivery-on-android-part-i/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">1c99b484-77d6-4583-83e4-abcd475b30f6</guid><category><![CDATA[Android]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renzo Crisóstomo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2013 14:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Three random thoughts on indie software development]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I have been thinking on three things about software development that I believe are somehow related:</p>

<ul>
<li>What they <em>don't tell you</em> about Agile... Or do they?</li>
<li>You can't do <em>everything</em> on your own... Or can you?</li>
<li>What's the best way to do everything <em>on your own</em>?
You may be wondering how they are related... Let me explain myself.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3 id="whattheydonttellyouaboutagile">What they don't tell you about Agile</h3>

<p>Agile is <strong>hard</strong>. Yes, we all have been lied about it. Let's analyze for instance two agile methodologies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scrum</li>
<li>eXtreme Programming</li>
</ul>

<p>On the first, you have three main roles: scrum master, product owner and the team, let's focus on the last one. As a team member, you should be involved on several tasks performing multiple roles in different disciplines such as requirements, design, construction, testing, maintenance and configuration management. Specialization is not forbidden, but multi-disciplinary teams are encourage.</p>

<p>On the second, you have a set of practices and some of them are really hard to get done right, like: test driven development and coding standards are really advanced stuff for junior software developers, continuous integration and small releases are somehow difficult to accomplish depending on your IT infrastructure, collective ownership could be a nightmare done wrong.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12352209/Blog/xp-practices.png" alt="xp-practices"></p>

<p>You get the idea.</p>

<h3 id="youcantdoeverythingonyourown">You can't do everything on your own</h3>

<p>You can't. I think some of us are getting the wrong idea about indie software development... What's indie on these days anyways? I'll explain this with two successful independent software development <em>teams</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tapbots.com/company/">Tapbots</a>, creators of the amazing iOS app Tweetbot.</li>
<li><a href="http://supermeatboy.com/about/">Team Meat</a>, creators of the video game hit Super Meat Boy.
Both teams are conformed by a developer and a designer, so it's clear that those aren't lone wolves and I think there's a reason about that. Most tasks on software development and design must be reviewed by different points of view, and it's so easy to miss a thing... Also, development and testing tasks should be done by someone different, otherwise is a disaster. If you want to learn more on how this teams are organized, I recommend reading both teams blogs and watch this awesome <a href="http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/">movie</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>What's the best way to do everything on <strong>your own</strong></p>

<p>Is Agile the best way? I think it is the right direction. I have been told that Apple apps teams are conformed by 3 people: a developer, a designer and a marketing analyst working with a methodology very similar to scrum. And reading both Tapbots and Team Meat blogs got me an idea on how are they organized, which is again very similar to scrum.</p>

<p>Scrum isn't recommended for teams of two people and I couldn't find information regarding an agile methodology for teams conformed by two people, so there's an interesting field of research there.</p>

<p>How are these three thoughts related?</p>

<ul>
<li>Independent software development it's <strong>hard</strong>. You have to fulfill multi-disciplinary roles and you have to be the best on each one, pretty much like doing agile, the right way.</li>
<li>You can't do everything on your own, but it seems that there is a kind of magic formula with two people teams.</li>
<li>There's an interesting field of research on this two people independent software development teams using kind of agile practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these has my attention for further research, so I'll keep you posted on this when I'll have more information.</p>]]></description><link>http://ruenzuo.github.io/three-random-thoughts-on-indie-software-development/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">67f7fd46-5717-4fd6-bc77-1b410481e5d4</guid><category><![CDATA[Agile]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renzo Crisóstomo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2013 09:33:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello, world]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It's been a little less than six years since my first "Hello, world".

<h3 id="thebest">The best</h3>

<p>I started my software engineering career on April 2008. I remember my first two programming courses, loved those! And I have to say, I was pretty good at them. In fact... I felt like one of the best students and it was awesome. I never was the best at anything before!</p>

<h3 id="thefirst">The first</h3>

<p>I don't remember exactly, I think it was mid 2009 when I read an article on Gizmodo about some mobile applications on a new platform making a lot of money only with one button and a thousand of fart sounds. Then I heard inside my head: "Hey! Listen! You can program that on C++, how different could it be?"</p>

<h3 id="thenaive">The naive</h3>

<p>On February 2010 I started my first job as a software developer doing Objective-C and eventually some Java programming for a <a href="http://onlinestudioproductions.com/">startup</a> at the time. It was pretty chaotic, but still felt great being paid for doing what I loved.</p>

<p>Then I published my second iOS application (I don't want to write about the first, I don't even remember that) on iTunes App Store around July 2010: <a href="http://www.appsafari.com/music/11565/iocarina/">iOcarina</a>. That went really great while it lasted, I bought my first car with that money and I have to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/cavf88">@cavf88</a> for that.</p>

<h3 id="thescared">The scared</h3>

<p>Everything until here sounds great, isn't it? Well it goes ugly from here. Nintendo wasn't happy with me using their copyrighted sounds so I had to remove my app from the store. Then, chaotic awesome went chaotic awful at work, so I quit. And it wasn't easy to quit that job, I'll tell you more about that some other time.</p>

<p>Then I felt confused, had a couple ideas for apps at my head but the App Store market wasn't the same anymore. I got a job in a couple of places but I really didn't enjoyed those. Was this really what I want for the rest of my live?</p>

<p>On May 2012 I took a Certified Scrum Master course thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/cegonya">@Cegonya</a> and I loved it! Suddenly I saw all the answers I was looking for: that was the way I wanted to work for the rest of my live, definitely.</p>

<h3 id="thedreamer">The dreamer</h3>

<p>On February 2013 I started working on a truly <a href="http://www.tallertechnologies.com/">agile organization</a>. This was awesome! Scrum, eXtreme Programming and Kanban. I worked with the best practices on software development: continuous integration, continuous delivery, unit testing and static code analysis. I also learned about the importance of open source software development and even started contributing to some small projects! And all these motivate me to start this blog.</p>
