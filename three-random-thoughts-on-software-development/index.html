			<h1>Three random thoughts on indie software development</h1>
			<p>I have been thinking on three things about software development that I believe are somehow related:</p>

<ol>
<li>What they <em>don't tell you</em> about Agile... Or do they?  </li>
<li>You can't do <em>everything</em> on your own... Or can you?  </li>
<li>What's the best way to do everything <em>on your own</em>?</li>
</ol>

<p>You may be wondering how they are related... Let me explain myself.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="whattheydonttellyouaboutagile">What they don't tell you about Agile</h3>

<p>Agile is <strong>hard</strong>. Yes, we all have been lied about it. Let's analyze for instance two agile methodologies: </p>

<ul>
<li>Scrum</li>
<li>eXtreme Programming</li>
</ul>

<p>On the first, you have three main roles: scrum master, product owner and the team, let's focus on the last one. As a team member, you should be involved on several tasks performing multiple roles in different disciplines such as requirements, design, construction, testing, maintenance and configuration management. Specialization is not forbidden, but multi-disciplinary teams are encourage.</p>

<p>On the second, you have a set of practices and some of them are really hard to get done right, like: test driven development and coding standards are really advanced stuff for junior software developers, continuous integration and small releases are somehow difficult to accomplish depending on your IT infrastructure, collective ownership could be a nightmare done wrong. </p>

<p class="image-center"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/xp-practices.png"></p>

<p>You get the idea.</p>

<h3 id="youcantdoeverythingonyourown">You can't do everything on your own</h3>

<p>You can't. I think some of us are getting the wrong idea about indie software development... What's indie on these days anyways? I'll explain this with two successful independent software development <em>teams</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tapbots.com/company/">Tapbots</a>, creators of the amazing iOS app Tweetbot.</li>
<li><a href="http://supermeatboy.com/about/">Team Meat</a>, creators of the video game hit Super Meat Boy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both teams are conformed by a developer and a designer, so it's clear that those aren't lone wolves and I think there's a reason about that. Most tasks on software development and design must be reviewed by different points of view, and it's so easy to miss a thing... Also, development and testing tasks should be done by someone different, otherwise is a disaster. If you want to learn more on how this teams are organized, I recommend reading both teams blogs and watch this awesome <a href="http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/">movie</a>.</p>

<h3 id="whatsthebestwaytodoeverythingonyourown">What's the best way to do everything <em>on your own</em></h3>

<p>Is Agile the best way? I think it is the right direction. I have been told that Apple apps teams are conformed by 3 people: a developer, a designer and a marketing analyst working with a methodology very similar to scrum. And reading both Tapbots and Team Meat blogs got me an idea on how are they organized, which is again very similar to scrum.</p>

<p>Scrum isn't recommended for teams of two people and I couldn't find information regarding an agile methodology for teams conformed by two people, so there's an interesting field of research there.</p>

<p>How are these three thoughts related?</p>

<ul>
<li>Independent software development it's <strong>hard</strong>. You have to fulfill multi-disciplinary roles and you have to be the best on each one, pretty much like doing agile, the right way.</li>
<li>You can't do everything on your own, but it seems that there is a kind of magic formula with two people teams.</li>
<li>There's an interesting field of research on this two people independent software development teams using kind of agile practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these has my attention for further research, so I'll keep you posted on this when I'll have more information.</p>
